## Action Broker

Responsibility

- Register and dispatch capability implementations (actions).
- Enforce capability-level permissions and propagate errors back to callers.

Key files

- `core/src/action_broker.rs` — registration, permission checks, and dispatch logic.

Key interfaces

- Capability registration API: register capability name, descriptor, and handler.
- Invocation API: call capability with inputs and obtain results or structured errors.

Common error paths and test cases

- Unauthorized invocation: ensure permission checks block execution and return structured errors.
- Capability runtime errors: capability panics or failures must be converted to ActionResult errors and published.
- Timeout and cancellation: verify long-running actions respect deadlines and cancel tokens.

Tuning

- Invocation concurrency limits per capability.
- Timeouts and retry policies for remote capability providers.

Example (mock capability)

- A test mock provider should implement the capability interface and publish an `ActionResult` event consumed by the EventBus to validate round-trip behavior.

## Tool Use metadata

When integrating with the LLM Tool Orchestrator, capabilities can advertise a function-calling schema via `CapabilityDescriptor.metadata`:

- `desc` (string): short description presented to the model.
- `schema` (string): JSON Schema for the parameters object.

The orchestrator converts this into the `tools` array sent to the model (Responses/Chat). If omitted, a permissive empty schema is used.
