# Roadmap (Loom OS 1.0)

Goal: Enable developers to build a long-running, observable, and extensible event‑driven Multi‑Agent System in Python/JS within 10 minutes. The system can act on the outside world via MCP/function‑call tools, while the Rust Core provides performance and reliability.

Layered architecture (bottom‑up):

- Core (Rust): EventBus (QoS/backpressure/stats), ActionBroker (capability registry/invocation/timeouts), ToolOrchestrator (unified tool parsing/refine/stats), Router (policies for privacy/latency/cost/quality).
- Bridge (protocol): gRPC or WebSocket for Agent registration, event streaming, capability invocation, heartbeat and backpressure signals.
- SDK (Python/JS): Agent abstraction (on_event), Context (emit/request/reply/tool/memory/join_thread), @capability declaration, collaboration primitives (fanout/fanin/barrier/contract‑net).
- Ecosystem: MCP client (ingest tools → capability directory → invoke), optional MCP server (expose Loom capabilities externally).
- UX: CLI (loom new/dev/bench/list), Dashboard (topology, swimlanes, latency, backpressure, routing, tool calls).

## P0 — Minimal viable multi‑language multi‑agent (highest priority)

Delivery target: Minimal Vertical Slice (MVS). Spin up 3 agents (Planner/Researcher/Writer) in Python/JS, collaborate via events to perform search and summarization, invoke web.search/weather.get; Dashboard shows basic event flow; single‑command run via CLI.

### ✅ Completed in P0

1. **Bridge (gRPC)** — ✅ COMPLETE
   - AgentRegister (topics, capabilities), bidirectional EventStream (publish/delivery)
   - Client-initiated ForwardAction, server-initiated ActionCall (internal push API + result correlation map)
   - Heartbeat, stateless reconnection
   - Integration tests: registration, event roundtrip, forward action, heartbeat
2. **Python SDK (loom‑py)** — ✅ COMPLETE

   - Core Agent/Context API: emit/reply/tool/request (with correlation_id)
   - @capability decorator with auto Pydantic input/output schema
   - Unified Envelope (thread_id/correlation_id/sender/reply_to/ttl/hop via metadata)
   - gRPC BridgeClient with RegisterAgent/EventStream/ForwardAction/Heartbeat
   - Agent orchestration: stream loop, capability invocation, action_result correlation
   - Packaging: `pyproject.toml` ready for PyPI (`0.1.0a1`)
   - Example: trio.py (Planner/Researcher/Writer collaboration)

3. **Collaboration primitives** — ✅ COMPLETE

   - request/reply with first_k/timeout strategies
   - fanout/fanin (any/first-k/majority)
   - barrier (wait for N replies or timeout)
   - contract-net (call for proposals/bids/award/execute)
   - Thread broadcast topic: `thread.{thread_id}.broadcast`
   - Reply topic: `thread.{thread_id}.reply`

4. **MCP Client** — ✅ COMPLETE

   - Connect to MCP servers via stdio → fetch tool JSON Schema → register as CapabilityDescriptor
   - McpClient (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio), McpToolAdapter (implements CapabilityProvider)
   - McpManager for multiple server lifecycle
   - Invoke MCP tools via ActionBroker with unified error codes (INVALID_PARAMS/TIMEOUT/TOOL_ERROR/...)
   - Configurable protocol version with validation
   - Auto-discovery and qualified tool naming (server:tool)
   - Comprehensive tests and documentation

5. **Directories** — ✅ COMPLETE
   - AgentDirectory: discover agents by id/topics/capabilities

   - Technology selection: Web (React/Vue + WebSocket) vs Terminal UI (Ratatui)
   - Real-time topology graph with auto-layout
   - Event swimlanes with thread_id grouping and filtering
   - Latency histograms (P50/P90/P99) per agent/capability
   - Backpressure gauges and QoS insights per topic
   - Error heatmaps and per-topic failure rates
   - Tool invocation timeline and success/failure breakdown

2. **CLI and templates** — 🎯 PRIORITY

   - `loom new <template>`: multi-agent, voice-assistant, home-automation, vision-camera, system-helper

3. **Streaming and parallelism**

   - SSE partial answers (LLM token streaming via ActionBroker)
   - Parallel tool invocation with semaphore/circuit breaker
   - Stream backpressure propagation to LLM providers
   - Chunked event payloads for large data (e.g., video frames)

4. **Error taxonomy and unified error_event**

   - Standardize error codes: MODEL_FALLBACK / TOOL_PARSE_ERROR / INVALID_PARAMS / CAPABILITY_ERROR / TIMEOUT / PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE
   - Publish error_event on dedicated topic for monitoring
   - Prometheus labels for error classification
   - Error recovery strategies (retry with exponential backoff, fallback provider)

5. **SDK ergonomics**

   - Memory plugins (pluggable KV backends: Redis, PostgreSQL, in-memory)
   - Better type hints and runtime validation (Pydantic v2 for Python)
   - Streaming API for long-running tasks (async generators)
   - Middleware hooks for logging, tracing, auth

6. **MCP enhancements**

   - SSE transport (HTTP-based) in addition to stdio
   - Resources API support (read/write/list resources)
   - Prompts API support (list/get prompts with arguments)
   - Sampling support for multi-turn tool use
   - Notifications support (server-initiated events)

7. **Cognitive agent pattern & memory system** — 🧪 EXPERIMENTAL

   - Define a `CognitiveLoop` interface (perceive/think/act) and a `CognitiveAgent` adapter that implements `AgentBehavior` on top of it (Rust core).
   - Provide a reference planner-style agent that uses `ContextBuilder`, `MemoryReader/Writer`, `ModelRouter`, and `ActionBroker` to run a simple reasoning loop.
   - Solidify `context::MemoryReader/Writer` as the primary memory extension point and document it as such.
   - Add at least one persistent memory implementation (e.g., RocksDB-backed episodic memory) to complement the in-memory demo store.
   - Document the design in `docs/core/cognitive_runtime.md` and `docs/core/memory.md`.

### 📋 Next Up (P1 Focus)

1. Dashboard MVP (web or terminal UI)
2. CLI basics (new/dev/list/bench)
3. JS SDK parity with Python
4. Streaming APIs and error taxonomy
5. MCP SSE transport and additional APIs

---

## Metrics and quality gates

- TTFM: ≤ 10 minutes (Python/JS).
- Stability: reconnect on drop; 24h longevity without memory blow‑ups.
- Performance: P99 event latency target < 200ms under mixed QoS (realtime path); tool invocation error rate < 2%.
- Observability: Prometheus/OTel metrics present; Dashboard first paint < 2s.

---

## Notes

- The Core already provides EventBus/ActionBroker/Router/ToolOrchestrator with pressure tests; on top of this, prioritize the minimal viable path for Bridge + SDK + Dashboard + MCP.
- The Voice Agent remains one of the showcase templates (available in the P1 template library).
